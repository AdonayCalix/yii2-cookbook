RBAC
====

RBAC which stands for Role Based Access Control is an access management system built into Yii. Despite [being described well in
official guide](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc-2.0/guide-security-authorization.html#rbac) there's no complete example on how
to use it. Let's fill the gap.

As an example we'll take article publishing system such as [YiiFeed](http://yiifeed.com/).

## Configuring RBAC component

## Planning roles and permissions hierarchy

## Filling hierarchy via migrations

## Assigning role to user

## Checking access

### Access filter

### Manually
